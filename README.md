# Remove Background from a signature with a white background

The function defined in this notebook removes the background of signatures or other text with a white background and saves it as a PNG file. It also cuts the image to the minimum size possible without losing any information and converts all the text to black.

To use the code one just has to put the image of the text in the folder ```input_image``` and specify the name of the file in the variable ```file_name```. The output will be saved in the folder ```output_image``` with the same name as the input file.

Overall this looks like this:
1. Input image

![Input Image](example_images/input_image.png)

2. Output image

![Output Image](example_images/output_image.png)
